    "text": "Objective: Construct a Bayesian Vector Autoregression model to forecast major macroeconomic indicators for the United States, Australia, Japan, and China to facilitate an investigation into the prospective interdependencies between the economies of these nations.\nQuestion: This research project will examine how trade relationships, investment flows, monetary policy environments, and economic performances within the United States, Australia, Japan and China mutually influence each other, and assess the implications of these interactions for predicting future values of these economic indicators.\nMotivation: Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the global economic landscape has witnessed a series of unprecedented shifts in key macroeconomic indicators, spurred by governments’ adoption of varied expansionary monetary policies. Initially, to buffer their economies, many nations implemented expansive monetary strategies, later swiftly transitioning to interest rate hikes in a bid to manage surging inflation rates—a scenario not seen in decades. The pandemic’s disruption to trade further exacerbated inflationary pressures for some economies, highlighting the intricate interdependencies among major economies with significant trade and financial ties. This period recorded stark contrast in inflation levels, with unprecedented highs in the US and Australia and notably low inflation in China and Japan. Amidst this turmoil, a divergence in economic paths also became apparent, the United States and Australia have witness robust economic rebounds, whereas China and Japan saw more tepid recoveries. This research aims to dissect the nuanced web of economic interdependencies between the United States, Australia, Japan, and China, analyzing how their trade relationships, investment flows, and monetary policy environments have mutually influenced their economic performances. Additionally, it seeks to understand the ramifications of these dynamics for the predictive accuracy of future economic indicators, offering insights into the evolving global economic order."
